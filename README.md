### Hi, I'm Robin!
I began my apprenticeship as a production mechanic at the age of 16. During my time in maintenance, I took on the responsibility of automation technology, which gave me my first exposure to programming. This experience was so engaging that it inspired me to transition into software development.

I am deeply motivated to continue expanding my knowledge and advancing in the field. I have successfully completed a bootcamp in web development, which has significantly enhanced my skills. In parallel, I am studying at 42 Heilbronn, an innovative school that follows a project-based learning model. Without traditional teachers or lecturers, students collaborate closely, learning from each other through hands-on projects. This approach has not only sharpened my technical expertise but also improved my problem-solving abilities and teamwork skills.

I am excited to continue my journey in software development, building on a solid foundation of technical knowledge and collaborative problem-solving.
